I used to start bi-weekly email/text with friends and family:
 "Hey what are you reading now? Do you like it?"
 "Any good sci-fi you've read this year?"
 "What are some of your favorite books or all time? 
 Do you have a hard copy I could borrow?"

I had all the same access to Amazon and Goodreads reviews just like everyone else, but I: 
    1. trusted their recommendations more than the masses, 
    2. loved being able to discuss the book afterwards with them

Enter BookBound. BookBound is a web application solely dedicated to sharing your favorite books with those you love and finding your next book from those you trust.
